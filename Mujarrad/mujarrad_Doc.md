# What is Mujarrad?

To understand Mujarrad, imagine two materials: **Cement** and **Powder**.

## The Problem: Cement

Most apps (like Excel, ClickUp, or Notion) are like **Cement**.

- Once you build a wall with cement, it is hard.
- If you want to change the wall, you must break it.
- It is rigid and expensive to change.

## The Solution: Powder

Mujarrad treats information like **Powder**.

- It is soft and flexible.
- You can shape it into anything you want.
- If you want to change it, you just reshape it. You don't have to break anything.

**Mujarrad is a tool that lets normal people build complex systems without writing code.**

# The 3 Magic Words

You only need to learn 3 words to understand how Mujarrad works.

## 1. Node (The Dot)

A **Node** is just one piece of information.

- It can be a Task.
- It can be a Person.
- It can be a Date.
- It can be a File.

In Mujarrad, everything is a Node. We don't use rigid tables. We use floating dots of information.

## 2. Relationship (The Wire)

A **Relationship** is the line that connects two Nodes.

- Example: "Task A" depends on "Task B".
- Example: "Manager" assigns "Project".

This is how we give meaning to the data. We wire them together.

## 3. Mode (The View)

We don't have "Pages" like a normal website. We have **Modes**. A Mode is just "how you look" at the Node. You can look at the same Node in 8 different ways:

1. **Scope**: Look at just one small part (Focus).
2. **Full View**: Look at the big map of connections (Graph).
3. **Edit**: Change the text inside the Node.
4. **Configure**: Change the settings or rules.
5. **Setup**: Connect the wires (Relationships).
6. **View**: Make it look easy for reading (like a blog).
7. **Annotate**: Write notes on top of the Node (like a sticky note).
8. **See**: Watch the Node work without touching it.

# Competitors

## Sanity.io

Sanity is great, but it is for **Developers**. You need to know code to use it.

**Mujarrad is for Everyone.** You get the power of Sanity, but you use it visually. No code needed.

## Tally.so

Tally is very simple. It is like a nice document.

It cannot run a complex company. It is too simple.

**Mujarrad is as easy to use as Tally, but it is powerful enough to run a big business.**

## Obsidian & ClickUp & Notion

- Obsidian is good for linking notes, but bad for tasks.
- ClickUp and Notion is good for tasks, but it is too rigid ("Cement").

**Mujarrad combines them.** We have the freedom of Obsidian with the power of ClickUp and Notion.
