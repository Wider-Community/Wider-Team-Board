# Wider Team Board

Welcome to the Wider Community team! This Obsidian vault serves as our central knowledge base for documentation and team resources.

## Getting Started

If you're a new intern, start here:

1. **Read the [[Onboarding Materials]]** - This is your first stop. It covers all the tools, workflows, and expectations for your internship.

2. **Set up your tools** - Follow the onboarding guide to get access to:
   - Slack (team communication)
   - GitHub (code repositories)
   - FigJam (collaboration)
   - This Obsidian vault

3. **Send daily status updates** - Once you're set up, remember to post your daily progress on Slack at midday.
