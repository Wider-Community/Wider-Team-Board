## 📱 Communication - Slack

Slack is our primary communication tool for team discussions, announcements, and quick questions.
### 📝 Daily Status Updates (Required)

**All interns are required to send a daily status update on Slack.**

#### When to Post
- Post your status update at **midday** (around 12:00 PM)
- If you're unable to work on a particular day, notify your supervisor in advance

#### What to Include
```
📅 Date: [Today's Date]

✅ What I've Finished:
- [Completed task 1]
- [Completed task 2]

🔄 What I'm Currently Working On:
- [Current task you're focused on]
- [Any ongoing work]

🚧 Blockers (if any):
- [Any issues preventing progress]
```

#### Why This Matters
- Keeps the team informed of your progress
- Helps identify blockers early so we can assist
- Builds accountability and time management skills
- Provides visibility for your contributions

> **Important:** Consistent daily updates are part of your internship evaluation. If you miss updates, your supervisor will follow up.

## 📋 Spec-Driven Development - Spec Kit

Spec Kit is a toolkit for Spec-Driven Development—a methodology that prioritizes creating detailed specifications before implementation.

### Why We Use It
- Focus on product scenarios and predictable outcomes
- Define requirements before jumping into code
- Multi-step refinement over single-prompt code generation
- Higher quality outputs for mission-critical projects

### Slash Commands
Once initialized in a project, you can use these commands with AI coding assistants:
- `/speckit.constitution` – Establish project principles
- `/speckit.specify` – Define requirements
- `/speckit.plan` – Create implementation strategies
- `/speckit.tasks` – Generate actionable task lists
- `/speckit.implement` – Execute the plan

### Supported AI Assistants
Works with 15+ coding assistants including:
- Claude
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Gemini
- Windsurf

### Getting Started
1. Install the Specify CLI (`specify`)
2. Initialize Spec Kit in your project
3. Follow the spec-driven workflow: Constitution → Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement
