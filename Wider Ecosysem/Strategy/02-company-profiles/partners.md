# Wider Hub Partners

## Build the Forge in Your Territory

---

## The Opportunity Before You

You've built something in your region. Relationships. Reputation. Understanding of what your market needs. But you've also felt the limitations—watching talent leave for other markets, watching companies struggle to find qualified people, watching the gap between potential and opportunity grow wider.

**What if you could close that gap?**

Not by starting from scratch. Not by building infrastructure that already exists. But by becoming the bridge—the local forge where raw talent meets real opportunity.

**A Wider Hub is not a franchise. It's a mission with economic reward.**

## The Philosophy of Partnership

### Why "Hub Partner"?

We chose these words deliberately.

**Hub**: A center of activity, connection, and exchange. Not a branch office. Not a satellite. A hub has its own gravity—it attracts talent, companies, and opportunity to itself.

**Partner**: A relationship between equals pursuing a shared goal. Not a licensee following rules. Not a franchisee replicating a formula. A partner shapes the future alongside us.

When you become a Hub Partner, you're not buying access to our platform. You're joining a movement to eliminate the waste that plagues talent markets everywhere.

### The Waste We're Eliminating

Every market has the same disease: talented people can't find opportunity, and companies can't find talent. They exist in the same geography, sometimes in the same building, but they can't see each other.

Traditional solutions create more friction. Recruitment agencies take massive fees. Job boards flood inboxes with noise. Training programs teach skills nobody asked for. The "solution" industry has become part of the problem.

**Wider operates on a different principle: Value flows to where it's needed because the ecosystem routes it there.**

Our machines don't replace human judgment—they remove the friction that prevents humans from finding each other. The Recommendation Engine doesn't decide who gets hired. It ensures the right people know the opportunity exists.

**A Hub Partner brings this capability to their territory.**

## What You're Really Building

### More Than a Business

When you launch a Wider Hub, you're building three things simultaneously:

**1. An Economic Engine**
Revenue from certifications, projects, placements, training, and shared infrastructure. Real money flowing to you because you're creating real value.

**2. A Talent Pipeline**
A continuous supply of forged professionals—people who don't just have skills but have proof of what they can do. Companies in your territory will come to you because you're the source of people who actually deliver.

**3. A Regional Transformation**
Brain drain reverses when talented people have reason to stay. Innovation accelerates when research connects to market need. Your territory becomes known as a place where things get built.

**The economic reward is real. But the legacy is larger.**

### The Forge Metaphor Applied

As a Hub Partner, you become **the smith of your region**.

The raw metal is everywhere—in universities, in companies, working independently, looking for direction. Your hub provides the heat (training), the hammer (real projects), and the shape (mentorship and verification) that transforms potential into power.

You're not competing with recruiters. You're making recruiters irrelevant.

You're not competing with training companies. You're creating professionals that no course could produce.

You're not competing with consulting firms. You're building an ecosystem that delivers more value at lower cost because it eliminates the waste they profit from.

## Three Hub Models

### Regional Hub

**What it is:** You operate the Wider ecosystem within a defined geographic territory—a city, a country, a region.

**Who this is for:**
- Business development organizations
- Investment promotion agencies
- Entrepreneurship networks
- Technology associations
- Individual leaders with strong local relationships

**What you do:**
- Onboard and certify talent from your territory
- Connect local companies to the network's capabilities
- Host events, training, and community gatherings
- Represent Wider in local partnerships and government relationships

**Example:** A Regional Hub in Riyadh certifies Saudi professionals, connects them to Gulf-wide projects, and becomes the recognized source of quality talent for companies entering the Saudi market.

### Industry Hub

**What it is:** You build a specialized vertical within a specific sector—Healthcare AI, Financial Services, Manufacturing, Creative Industries.

**Who this is for:**
- Industry consultants with deep domain expertise
- Professional associations
- Specialized training organizations
- Former executives who understand an industry's real needs

**What you do:**
- Define certification standards specific to your industry
- Curate talent pools with relevant domain knowledge
- Build relationships with companies in your sector
- Create industry-specific products and training

**Example:** An Industry Hub for Healthcare AI certifies clinical data scientists, builds relationships with hospital systems and health tech companies, and becomes the recognized source of qualified talent for digital health initiatives.

### Enterprise Hub

**What it is:** You deploy the Wider ecosystem inside a large organization to manage internal talent, projects, and cross-functional collaboration.

**Who this is for:**
- Large corporations with distributed teams
- Conglomerates seeking cross-subsidiary optimization
- Government agencies modernizing workforce management
- Organizations ready to treat talent as a strategic asset

**What you do:**
- Implement Wider's infrastructure for internal talent routing
- Track skills, contributions, and development across the organization
- Enable project-based collaboration across divisions
- Reduce duplication and waste in talent utilization

**Example:** An Enterprise Hub inside a multinational conglomerate routes specialized skills across subsidiaries, eliminates redundant hiring, and builds an internal economy of contribution and recognition.

## The Economics: How Partners Earn

### Revenue Sharing Model

You earn a percentage of all value created through your hub:

| Revenue Stream | Your Share | What Creates It |
|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Member Certification | 40-60% | Each person who becomes a Wider Network member through your hub |
| Spotlight Memberships | 50% | Premium visibility subscriptions from your members |
| Project Service Fees | 20-30% | Projects delivered by your hub's certified talent |
| Client Subscriptions | 30-40% | Companies paying for ongoing access to your talent pool |
| Training Programs | 40-50% | Wider Smith certification programs you deliver |
| Compute Services | 20-30% | AI infrastructure accessed through your hub |
| IP Licensing | 15-25% | Products and methods developed within your hub |

### The Math of Value Creation

**Year 1 Example (Conservative):**

- Certify 100 members at $500 average → $50,000 × 50% = **$25,000**
- Deliver $200,000 in client projects → $40,000 in fees × 25% = **$10,000**
- Generate $30,000 in recurring subscriptions × 40% = **$12,000**
- Host 2 corporate training programs × $5,000 = **$10,000**

**Year 1 Partner Revenue: ~$57,000**

**Year 3 Example (Growth trajectory):**

- 500 certified members generating ongoing activity
- $1M+ in annual project flow
- 50+ corporate relationships
- Multiple training and certification programs

**Year 3 Partner Revenue: $200,000 - $400,000+**

The economics improve as your hub matures because reputation compounds. The hub that certifies the best talent attracts the best clients, which attracts more talent, which creates more value.

## The Partner Advantage

### What Sets This Apart

**Zero-Waste Infrastructure:**
You're not building from scratch. The platform, the machines, the methodology—they exist. You're deploying proven infrastructure, not hoping your experiment works.

**Network Effects:**
Your members can collaborate with the global talent pool. Your clients can access capabilities from across the network. You're not building an island—you're joining a continent.

**Compound Reputation:**
As your hub certifies excellent talent and delivers quality projects, your reputation grows. Better reputation attracts better talent and clients. The flywheel accelerates.

**Shared Evolution:**
When any hub develops a capability, all hubs can benefit. You're part of a collaborative system that gets stronger over time, not a competitive market that tears itself apart.

### What You're Really Buying

**Time Compression:**
What would take years to build independently—platform, brand, methodology, client relationships—you access immediately.

**Risk Reduction:**
The model is proven. The economics work. You're not betting on an untested idea—you're executing a validated approach in your market.

**Scale Potential:**
As a partner, you can grow as large as your ambition and execution allow. There's no ceiling on hub development—only the limits of your vision.

**Meaningful Work:**
You're not just building a business. You're eliminating waste, creating opportunity, and forging talent. The economic reward and the meaningful impact aren't in conflict—they reinforce each other.

## The Invitation

### A Different Kind of Partnership

Most partnerships are transactional. You pay a fee, you get access, you're on your own.

Wider partnership is relational. We succeed when you succeed. Your growth is our growth. We're building something together that neither could build alone.

**This isn't for everyone.**

It's for people who see a broken system and want to fix it.
It's for people who believe talent should find opportunity without gatekeepers extracting value.
It's for people who want to build something that matters while building something sustainable.

If that's you, let's talk.

### Next Steps

**Explore:**
Review this material. Think about your territory. Imagine what a thriving hub would mean for your region.

**Connect:**
Reach out to our partnerships team. Have a conversation about your vision. Ask hard questions—we'll give honest answers.

**Decide:**
If it feels right, begin the journey. If it doesn't, no pressure. We'd rather have the right partners than many partners.
