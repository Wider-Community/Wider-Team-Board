# Wider Hub Partners: Build Your Regional Innovation Ecosystem

## Executive Summary

Wider Hub Partners represent the expansion layer of the Wider Network—the regional and industry-specific leaders who bring the power of our interconnected ecosystem to local markets, sectors, and organizations.

As a Hub Partner, you don't just license technology. You become the architect of opportunity in your territory. You operate a verified talent network, give local businesses access to world-class AI infrastructure, and earn revenue from every project, placement, and partnership you enable.

**The Opportunity:** Wider eliminates 60-80% of the traditional barriers to building a talent network. We provide the platform, the machines, the methodology, and the brand. You provide local market knowledge, relationships, and execution.

**The Return:** Hub Partners earn revenue share on all economic activity within their hub—from member certifications to client project fees to compute services—while maintaining local authority and decision-making power.

## The Hub Partner Opportunity

### What is a Wider Hub?

A Wider Hub is a regional or industry-specific node within the global Wider ecosystem. It functions as:

- **A B2B Integration Center**: Where local companies connect capabilities and access intelligent matching
- **A Talent Certification Hub**: Where individuals undergo Wider's standardized training to become Network Members
- **A Revenue-Generating Franchise**: Where partners earn from memberships, project fees, and value-added services
- **A Strategic Growth Engine**: Where local innovation meets global infrastructure

### Three Hub Models

#### 1. Regional Hub
Operate Wider's ecosystem within a defined geographic territory (city, country, or region).

**Example**: A business development organization in Dubai operating Wider UAE, onboarding local talent and connecting regional enterprises to the global network.

#### 2. Industry Hub
Build a specialized vertical within a specific sector (Healthcare AI, Financial Services, Manufacturing, etc.).

**Example**: A consultancy specializing in healthcare technology launching Wider Health, certifying medical data specialists and matching them to digital health projects.

#### 3. Enterprise Hub
Deploy an internal Wider Network inside a large organization to manage talent, projects, and cross-functional collaboration.

**Example**: A multinational corporation implementing Wider internally to coordinate distributed teams, manage IP, and optimize resource allocation across divisions.

## Revenue Model & Economics

### Revenue Sharing Structure

Hub Partners earn a percentage of all value generated within their hub. Revenue flows from multiple streams:

| Revenue Stream | Partner Share | Description |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Member Certification Fees** | 40-60% | Fees paid by individuals joining the Wider Network through your hub |
| **Spotlight Memberships** | 50% | Recurring subscriptions for premium member visibility |

| **Client Subscription Fees** | 30-40% | Recurring fees from companies accessing your hub's talent pool |
| **Training & Capacity Building** | 40-50% | Revenue from Wider Smith certification programs delivered locally |
| **Compute & Infrastructure Services** | 20-30% | Fees from clients using Wider's AI infrastructure through your hub |
| **Licensing & IP Revenue** | 15-25% | Share of licensing revenue from IP developed within your hub |

**Example Economics:**

- Hub certifies 200 members at $500/member → $100,000 → **Partner earns $50,000** (50%)
- Hub delivers $500,000 in client projects → Service fee of $100,000 → **Partner earns $25,000** (25%)
- Hub generates $50,000/year in recurring subscriptions → **Partner earns $20,000/year** (40%)

**Total Year 1 Potential**: $95,000+ in revenue share, scaling with hub growth.

## What Sets Wider Hub Partners Apart

### 1. Zero-Waste Ecosystem
Unlike traditional franchise models where you build everything from scratch, Wider eliminates redundant effort:
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Access to AI compute, data pipelines, and automation tools at cost
- **Collaborative Development**: When one hub builds a capability, all hubs benefit
- **Network Effects**: Your members can collaborate with the global talent pool on complex projects

### 2. Value-First Economics
Wider's philosophy ensures partners and members win before the platform takes a cut:
- **Outcome-Based Revenue**: Fees are triggered only after value is delivered to clients
- **Member-First Model**: Contributors are compensated before platform fees are deducted
- **Long-Term Sustainability**: Recurring revenue from satisfied clients, not transactional churn

### 3. Intelligent Matching at Scale
The Recommendation Engine eliminates manual matchmaking:
- **Skills-Based Routing**: Members are matched to projects based on verified capabilities, not resumes
- **Load Balancing**: Work is distributed across available talent to prevent burnout and maximize throughput
- **Cross-Hub Collaboration**: Regional hubs can form "leagues" to tackle multinational projects

### 4. Dual-Currency System
Wider's Credits and Points model aligns financial incentives with ecosystem health:
- **Credits**: Members pay certification fees and earn project revenue
- **Points**: Members gain reputation through quality delivery, unlocking priority access and governance rights
- **Partner Benefit**: High-point members attract premium clients, increasing hub revenue
