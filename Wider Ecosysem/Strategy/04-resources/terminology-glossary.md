## Economic Terms

### Credits (Hard Currency)
Monetary unit purchased with cash or earned through high-value work. Used for: platform fees, compute reservation, premium placements, goods/services. Treated as liabilities until redeemed.

### Points (Soft Currency)
Non-monetary, non-withdrawable units representing earned trust and contribution. Used for: governance participation, priority access, eligibility for grants/roles. Cannot convert to Credits.

### Dual Currency Mechanism
Wider's incentive system using Credits + Points. Golden Rule: Points never convert to Credits; they influence how Credits flow (e.g., higher points = lower fees).

### Activity-Based Costing (ABC)
Accounting methodology assigning costs to specific activities (GPU hours, dev hours, data processing) rather than spreading evenly. Enables precise internal pricing.

### Internal Transfer Pricing
Pricing mechanism when machines serve other machines or network participants. Formula: Cost + 5-15% margin.

### Machine-as-a-Cost-Center
Accounting principle treating each machine as an independent economic unit with its own costs, outputs, pricing, and performance metrics.

### Shadow P&L
Internal profit-and-loss view for each machine to assess cost recovery, efficiency, and strategic value.

### Value Units
Standardized measures of machine output (datasets, matches, placements, content assets, software modules). Used to calculate cost per unit.
