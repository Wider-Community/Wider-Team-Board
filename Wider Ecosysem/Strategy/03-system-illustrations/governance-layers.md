# Wider Governance Layers

## Concentric Circle Model: Authority and Economic Relationships

The Wider Network is structured as concentric layers of responsibility, authority, and economic participation, where authority and standards flow outward from the center, while value creation, capital, and opportunities flow inward through verified participation.

## Incentive Alignment Principles

### 1. Contribution ↔ Compensation
- **Core Principle**: Economic rewards scale with contribution level
- **Mechanism**: Credits for value delivery, Points for ecosystem health
- **Result**: Higher contribution = Higher earning potential + Higher authority

### 2. Accountability ↔ Authority
- **Core Principle**: Greater authority requires greater accountability
- **Mechanism**: Core Team has final say but carries systemic risk
- **Result**: Decision-making power tied to responsibility for outcomes

### 3. Quality ↔ Reputation
- **Core Principle**: Long-term ecosystem health over short-term gains
- **Mechanism**: Points system rewards quality, not just quantity
- **Result**: Quality work → Higher Points → Better opportunities → More authority

## Governance Mechanisms

### Standards Flow (Center → Edge)
1. **Core Team** defines: Pricing models, quality standards, KPIs
2. **Interns/Volunteers** enforce: Community moderation, validation
3. **Network Members** execute: Deliver to defined standards
4. **Hub Partners** localize: Adapt standards to regional context
5. **Client Staff** validate: Approve based on standards met

### Value Flow (Edge → Center)
1. **Client Staff** injects: Capital through project budgets
2. **Hub Partners** expand: Geographic reach and market access
3. **Network Members** deliver: Project execution and outcomes
4. **Volunteers** strengthen: Trust and social validation
5. **Interns** support: Cost-effective operational scaling
6. **Core Team** aggregates: Platform-wide value and revenue

---

## Concentric Layer Interactions

### Core ↔ Interns
- Core provides: Learning frameworks, supervision, tools
- Interns provide: Scalable support, fresh perspectives, future talent

### Core ↔ Volunteers
- Core provides: Platform infrastructure, Points system, recognition
- Volunteers provide: Community health, moderation, trust signals

### Core ↔ Network Members
- Core provides: Project routing, infrastructure, governance
- Members provide: Value delivery, revenue generation, market validation

### Network Members ↔ Client Staff

- Clients provide: Capital, requirements, milestone approvals

### Hub Partners ↔ All Layers
- Partners provide: Local market access, regional onboarding, localization
- Receive: Infrastructure access, revenue share, brand association

## Quality and Ethics Enforcement

### Layer-Specific Controls

**Core Team Level**:
- Strategic oversight
- Financial audits
- Dispute resolution
- System-wide policy enforcement

**Network Member Level**:
- Certification requirements
- Performance tracking
- Peer reviews
- Client feedback integration

**Hub Partner Level**:
- Compliance monitoring
- Quality standard enforcement
- Regional adaptation within guidelines
- Revenue-sharing compliance

## Summary: The Layered Ecosystem

The Wider governance structure ensures that:

1. **Authority flows outward** - Standards, trust, and governance radiate from the center
2. **Value flows inward** - Capital, opportunities, and market feedback return to the core
3. **Risk is distributed** - Inner layers carry systemic risk; outer layers carry market risk
4. **Rewards are aligned** - Contribution and accountability determine compensation
5. **Quality is enforced** - Multiple validation layers ensure ecosystem integrity
6. **Growth is sustainable** - Each layer supports the others in a reinforcing cycle

This concentric model creates a **self-regulating, self-reinforcing ecosystem** where economic incentives, governance authority, and value creation are perfectly aligned for long-term sustainability and growth.
