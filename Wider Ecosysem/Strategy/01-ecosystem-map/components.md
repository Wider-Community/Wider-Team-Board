## Economic Model Components

The Wider ecosystem operates on sophisticated economic mechanisms designed to reward contribution, sustain growth, and maintain trust.

### Dual Currency System

The ecosystem uses two complementary, non-convertible currencies to align incentives without excessive monetary cost.

#### Credits (Hard Currency)

**Nature:** Financial value, auditable, monetary

**Purpose:**
Represent claims on scarce resources and enable economic transactions within the ecosystem.

**Acquisition:**
- Purchase with cash
- Earn through high-value work delivery
- Receive as project payments
- Performance-based rewards

**Use Cases:**
- Pay platform fees
- Reserve machine capacity (compute, data, engineering)
- Acquire premium placements
- Subscription access
- Purchase assets and services
- Enterprise service fees

**Accounting Treatment:**
- **Issued Credits:** Deferred revenue / Platform liability
- **Redeemed Credits:** Recognized revenue
- **Expired Credits:** Breakage income (if applicable)

**Properties:**
- Monetary and auditable
- Tied directly to delivery and machines
- Recorded on balance sheet as liability until redeemed

**Flow Example:**
1. Client deposits credits (creates liability)
2. Credits allocated to project (reserved)
3. Machines consume credits internally (cost recovery)
4. Members earn credits for delivery (payment)
5. Credits redeemed for services/fees (revenue recognition)

---

#### Points (Soft Currency)

**Nature:** Behavioral, non-transferable, reputation-based

**Purpose:**
Represent earned trust, contribution, and ecosystem value, influencing access and authority.

**Acquisition:**
- Awarded for mentoring others
- Earned through content sharing
- Granted for peer reviews
- Rewarded for community support
- Given for quality contributions

**Use Cases:**
- Governance participation
- Priority access (queues, reviews, routing)
- Eligibility for grants and scholarships
- Reputation and authority weighting
- Role progression enablement

**Accounting Treatment:**
- Not financial assets or liabilities
- Recorded as off-balance-sheet ecosystem metrics
- Used in governance, access control, prioritization logic

**Properties:**
- Non-monetary
- Non-withdrawable
- Non-transferable
- Behavioral and authority-driven

**Impact Examples:**
- High points → Lower platform fees
- High points → Priority project access
- High points → Eligibility for grants or subsidized credits
- Low points → Restricted access or higher collateral

**Golden Rule:**
Points never convert to Credits. They only influence how Credits flow. This preserves financial integrity, trust integrity, and anti-gaming protection.

### Currency Interaction by Layer

| Layer | Credits Interaction | Points Interaction |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Core Team** | Controls issuance, allocates reserves, approves pricing | Sets scoring frameworks, defines governance thresholds |
| **Interns** | Receive stipends/milestone credits | Earn for participation, learning, reliability |
| **Volunteers** | No direct credits | Primary reward mechanism |
| **Network Members** | Pay membership, earn from projects | Affect routing, visibility, pricing tiers |
| **Client Staff** | Fund projects, subscriptions | Typically not accumulated |
| **Hub Partners** | Earn revenue shares | Earned through growth, compliance, quality |

---

### Activity-Based Costing (ABC) Model

**Purpose:**
Calculate true cost of machine operations by assigning costs to specific activities rather than spreading evenly.

**Implementation:**

#### Step 1: Define Each Machine as Cost Center
- Create five cost centers (one per machine)
- Each has: Direct costs, Allocated shared costs, Activity metrics, Internal transfer prices

#### Step 2: Cost Categories

**Direct Costs:**
- Human cost: Salaries, stipends, mentor time
- Compute: GPU hours, cloud compute, storage
- Software: Licenses, data sources, tools
- Operations: QA, monitoring, deployment

**Shared Infrastructure Costs (Allocated):**
- 200-GPU super-computer
- Core platform infrastructure
- Security, DevOps, data governance

**Allocation Basis:**
- GPU compute → GPU-hours consumed
- Storage → TB-months used
- Network → API calls / data volume
- Core staff → % time allocated

#### Step 3: Measure Activities (ABC)

**Example - Coding Machine:**

| Activity | Cost Driver |
|----------|-------------|
| Proof of Concept | Hours + GPU |
| Feature Delivery | Story points |
| Integration | API calls |
| Maintenance | Tickets resolved |

**Formula:**
Activity Cost = (Labor hours × Hourly rate) + (GPU hours × GPU rate) + Allocated overhead

#### Step 4: Output as Value Units

**Machine Output Measures:**

| Machine | Value Units |
|---------|-------------|
| Mujarrad | Clean datasets, pipelines, data products |
| Recommendation Engine | Matches, successful routing, conversion lift |
| People Machine | Qualified placements, team formations |
| Content Machine | Approved content assets |
| Coding Machine | Deployable software modules |

**Track:**
- Cost per unit
- Revenue per unit (if external)
- Internal value (if internal)

#### Step 5: Internal Transfer Pricing

**When one machine serves another:**
- Charge internally (not "free work")
- Prevents overuse
- Forces prioritization
- Reveals real economics
- Enables profitability analysis

**Formula:**
Internal price ≠ market price
Internal price = cost + small margin (5–15%)

#### Step 6: Machine-Level P&L (Monthly)

**Revenue:**
- External client revenue
- Internal service revenue (transfer pricing)
- Subscriptions / retainers

**Cost:**
- Direct costs
- Allocated infrastructure
- Training & mentoring

**Classification:**
- Profit-generating
- Strategic (loss-leader)
- Infrastructure-critical

### Network Accounting (Dual-Ledger Model)

**Core Principle:**
Money follows delivery. Authority follows contribution.

**Two Complementary Ledgers:**

1. **Credits Ledger (Hard Currency):** Financial accounting
2. **Points Ledger (Soft Currency):** Contribution accounting

**Interaction Flow:**
1. Client deposits credits
2. Credits allocated to project
3. Machines consume credits internally
4. Members earn credits for delivery
5. Points adjust future routing and pricing

**Economic Interaction Loop:**

```
Capital & Standards (Outward) → Core Team → Machines
                                    ↓
Capacity & Services → Machines → Network Members
                                    ↓
Delivery & Revenue → Members → Clients
                                    ↑
Trust & Contribution (Inward) ← Points System
```

**Closed-Loop Logic:**
- Capital and standards flow outward from Core Team
- Capacity and services flow from machines to network
- Delivery and revenue flow from members to clients
- Trust, contribution, human capital flow inward through points, performance, governance

---

### Revenue Streams Summary

| Stream | Mechanism | Trigger |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Revenue Campaigns | Management/success fees | Campaign impact achievement |
| Spotlight Memberships | Recurring subscription | Enhanced visibility services |
| Contribution Service/Share | Service fee deduction | Successful project delivery |
| Opportunity Discovery | Success fees | Opportunity converts to funded project |
| Multiplier Commission | Embedded commission | Milestone approval |
| Licensing & IP | Royalty/license shares | After creator payouts |
| Training & Capacity Building | Revenue share/program fees | Participant milestone completion |
| Compute & Data-Center Services | Usage fees | Infrastructure utilization |
| Digital Transformation Consulting | Outcome-based fees | Confirmed improvements |

**Philosophy:**
All revenue captured AFTER value delivered to stakeholders. "Time to value" - participants win first, Wider earns second.

---

### Persona Identification & Mapping

**Purpose:**
Every individual must be clearly identified and mapped for operational clarity, communication efficiency, and accurate accounting.

**Two-Layer Identification:**

#### Layer 1: Persona Group
Assign to one primary category:
- Hub Partner
- Client Staff
- Network Member
- Volunteer
- Intern
- Core Team

#### Layer 2: Department/Skill Set
Every individual must have:
- Clearly defined role
- Recognized skill domain or functional responsibility
- Known position within operational structure

**Ensures:**
- Transparent and traceable responsibilities
- Efficient communication between stakeholders
- Measurable and evaluable contributions
- Correct allocation of financial and non-financial currencies

**Principle:**
No participation within Wider is undefined. Each persona becomes a measurable, accountable, and communicable unit enabling sustainable scale with maintained governance, transparency, and integrity.
