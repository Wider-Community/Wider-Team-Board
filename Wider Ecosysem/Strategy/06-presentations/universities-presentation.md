# Wider for Universities
## The Forge for Tomorrow's Builders

---

## Slide 1: The Problem

**Graduation ≠ Employment**

- Years of education
- Diploma printed
- World doesn't know how to receive them

*The market doesn't reject graduates because they're unqualified.*
*It rejects them because it doesn't see them.*

---

## Slide 2: The Question

**Traditional:** How do we place graduates into jobs?

**Wider:** How do we forge graduates into professionals the world actually needs?

---

## Slide 3: The Smith Philosophy

**Raw Metal → Finished Professional**

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| Heating | Exposure to real requirements |
| Hammering | Practice under pressure |
| Shaping | Mentorship and guidance |
| Tempering | Verification and proof |

*We don't fix students. We forge them.*

---

## Slide 4: The Waste Problem

**Every year:**
- Brilliant projects die in archives
- Research papers sit unread
- Solutions solve problems nobody knows about

**Wider refuses to accept waste.**

---

## Slide 5: Academic Repurposing

**Traditional Path:**
Research → Journal → Archive → Forgotten

**Wider Path:**
Research → Wider Labs → Product → Market → Revenue

- Student maintains IP stake
- University earns revenue share
- Knowledge becomes wealth

---

## Slide 6: Two Production Paths

**The Model Path**
- Research becomes trained AI model
- Deployed once, generates continuous revenue
- Partners cover operational costs

**The Agentic Path**
- Research becomes interactive solution
- Users pay for recurring engagement
- Maximizes Lifetime Value

---

## Slide 7: AQWAM Technology

**The Soul Technology**

- Holistic discovery of identity
- Self-management framework
- Each student becomes hero of their story

*When students discover authentic identity, they stop performing and start becoming.*

---

## Slide 8: The Hub Partner Model

**Your university becomes:**
- Center of innovation for your region
- Node in global network of talent and opportunity
- System-readable component in intelligent grid

**Not just education. The market itself.**

---

## Slide 9: What You Get

- Complete platform (Network, Hub, Marketplace, Community)
- Five Machines (Data, Routing, People, Content, Coding)
- Pooling of students into availability teams
- Dynamic assignment based on skills
- Revenue sharing on all economic activity

---

## Slide 10: The Wider Interns Program

**The Gap = Bridge, Not Cliff**

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Discovery | Join community, build portfolio |
| Forging | Real projects, supervised |
| Empowerment | Certified Network Member |

*Zero Injustice Rule: Opportunity guaranteed. Success earned.*

---

## Slide 11: The Smith System

**Reputation Through Work, Not Words**

1. **Theory** - Learn, certify
2. **Experimentation** - Practice in sandbox
3. **Monetization** - Real projects, real stakes
4. **Verification** - Testimonials, documented outcomes

*You don't talk about yourself. The ecosystem talks about you.*

---

## Slide 12: Dual Currency

**Credits (Hard)**
- Financial value
- Earned through work
- Auditable, real

**Points (Soft)**
- Reputation value
- Earned through contribution
- Governance, priority access

*Points never convert to Credits. Points influence how Credits flow.*

---

## Slide 13: Revenue Streams

| Stream | Your Share |
|--------|-----------|
| Project Revenue | 15-25% |
| Placement Commission | Per hire |
| Training Licensing | Corporate programs |
| Research Royalties | Commercialized work |
| Facility Usage | Assessment hosting |

---

## Slide 14: Implementation Path

| Phase | Timeline | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Foundation | Months 1-2 | Agreement, training, pilot cohort |
| Launch | Months 3-4 | Onboard students, start projects |
| Growth | Months 5-12 | Scale, revenue, success stories |
| Leadership | Year 2+ | Regional innovation center |

---

## Slide 15: Two Futures

**Future A:**
Graduate students. Hope they find their way. Watch research gather dust.

**Future B:**
Become the forge. Turn projects into products. Students into professionals who create opportunity.

---

## Slide 16: The Philosophy

> "A person alone is just a talent, but with the community they become a force."

> "The Smith doesn't reject impure metal. The Smith heats it, hammers it, shapes it, and reveals what was always possible."

---

## Slide 17: Call to Action

**Let's have a conversation.**

Not a sales pitch. A dialogue between people who believe education should end not with a diploma but with a transformation.
