The **Slack Agent** is an internal AI-powered assistant designed to improve **async coordination, visibility, and accountability** within Slack workspaces.  
It automates routine communication tasks, reduces meeting overhead, and keeps teams aligned without interrupting their flow.

The agent operates primarily through **Slack channels, threads, and DMs**, acting as a lightweight async manager rather than a chatty bot.
