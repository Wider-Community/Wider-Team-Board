# Wider Team Handbook

This document serves as the comprehensive guide for all team members and leaders at Wider. It covers the member integration process, leadership responsibilities, and common team processes.

## Part 1: Member Integration

Our team follows a structured three-phase approach to ensure every new member is properly equipped, informed, and integrated into our work culture.

### Phase 1: Onboarding

**Objective:** Equip new members with the necessary tools and access to begin their work.

#### What We Provide

- **Communication & Collaboration Tools:** Slack workspace access, email account, calendar access, and introduction to communication channels and response expectations.

- **Work & Documentation Platforms:** Access to project management tools, documentation repositories, and version control systems.

---

### Phase 2: Induction

**Objective:** Clarify roles, responsibilities, and working methods for all team members.

#### Key Activities

- **Team Structure & Responsibilities:** Introduction to team members and their roles, explanation of position responsibilities, overview of organizational hierarchy, and identification of direct supervisors or team leads.

- **Workflows & Project Management:** Understanding of project methodologies, task assignment and tracking procedures, meeting schedules (bi-weekly standups, bi-weekly leader meetings, 6-week cycle meetings), and collaboration protocols.

- **Reporting & Communication Standards:** Daily status updates via Slack bot, work logging requirements for cycle meetings, escalation procedures for blockers, and response time expectations across channels.

- **Resources & Support Systems:** Location of documentation and guidelines, contact points for technical/administrative issues, available learning resources, and mentorship or feedback opportunities.

---

### Phase 3: Orientation

**Objective:** Establish professional standards, communication protocols, and accountability measures.

#### Professional Conduct (Remote Work)

- **Remote Work Expectations:** Professional communication in all written and verbal interactions, punctuality for meetings and deadlines and respect for async communication and different time zones.

- **Company Policies:** Confidentiality and data protection standards, code of conduct acknowledgment and appropriate use of company resources.

#### Accountability & Performance

- **Core Expectations:** Quality deliverables meeting defined standards, proactive communication about challenges or delays, consistent work logging for transparency, and commitment to continuous learning and collaboration.

- **Feedback & Growth:** Regular check-ins with team leaders, performance evaluations at defined intervals, open communication for concerns or suggestions, and participation in knowledge sharing across teams.

### 1. Skills Collection & Team Balancing

- **Prioritize Backlog** - Move important tasks to "To Do"
- **Assign Tasks** - Match tasks to team members based on skills and availability
- **Track Progress** - Monitor task movement through the board
- **Review PRs** - Ensure code quality before merging

#### Task Assignment Process

```
1. Review Available Tasks
        ↓
2. Assess Team Member Skills & Workload
        ↓

| **Interest** | Has the member shown interest in this area? |

---

### 3. Status Collection

Leaders receive team member status via the [[SlackBot.md|Slack Bot]]:

- **Async Standups** - The bot prompts team members daily for what they worked on, what they plan to do, and any blockers
- **Daily Summary** - Leaders receive a generated standup summary with all collected responses
- **Automatic Reminders** - The bot sends nudges to members who miss their standup updates

---

## Part 3: Common Processes

### Meeting Cadence

| Meeting Type | Frequency | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Team Standups** | Bi-weekly | Each team leader holds a standup with their team |
| **Leader Meetings** | Bi-weekly | All team leaders align on priorities and blockers |
| **Cycle Meetings** | Every 6 weeks | All teams present logged work and project progress |
| **Ad-hoc** | As needed | Urgent cross-team collaboration |

#### Standup Meeting Format

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Frequency** | Bi-weekly |
| **Duration** | 15-30 minutes |
| **Format** | Each member shares updates |
| **Camera** | Off; active participation through voice and chat |

#### Standup Questions

1. What did you complete since the last standup?
2. What are you working on today?
3. Are there any blockers?

---

### Communication Channels

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Slack** | Daily communication, status updates, quick questions |
| **WhatsApp** | Urgent matters, quick coordination |
| **GitHub** | Task discussions, code reviews, technical feedback |
| **Meetings** | Standups, planning, retrospectives |

#### Communication Protocols

- **Daily Status Updates:** Submit updates via Slack bot by end of workday including tasks completed, current work, and any blockers. Team leaders must be kept informed of all significant updates, progress changes, or issues.

- **Reporting Chain:** Communicate all blockers, delays, or scope changes immediately to team leader. Use appropriate urgency levels (direct message for urgent, daily status for routine). Keep transparent documentation of work for cycle meeting reviews.

---

### Sprint Presentations

Each sprint concludes with a dedicated presentation. The members of each small squad collaborate on writing and preparing the content for their portion of the presentation. The team member responsible for communication — or a designated delegate — records the video and handles the editing (montage).

All individual squad videos for the sprint are then merged into a single comprehensive video covering the entire sprint.

#### Video Requirements

| Criteria                    | Details                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Minimum Duration**        | 8 minutes                         |
| **Maximum Duration**        | 15 minutes                        |
| **Total Videos per Sprint** | 5 (one per team across all teams) |

- **Under 8 minutes** is considered an **administrative issue**, indicating that resources have not been properly utilized and developed. This must be formally addressed and resolved.
- **Over 15 minutes** is considered a **communication management issue**, indicating a problem in crafting concise and effective messaging. This must also be addressed and resolved.

## Key Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Remote-First Culture** | We respect async communication and trust our team members to manage their time effectively |
| **Transparency** | Daily updates and work logging ensure everyone stays informed and aligned on progress |
| **Communication** | Leaders must be kept in the loop. When in doubt, over-communicate rather than under-communicate |
| **Collaboration** | Despite being remote, we maintain strong connections through regular meetings and open channels |

---

**Remember:** Success in our environment depends on clear communication, self-management, and keeping your team leader informed of your progress and challenges.
