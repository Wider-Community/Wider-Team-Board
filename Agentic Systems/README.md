## Overview
This directory will be a  knowledge reference for `Agentic Systems`, Sharing team knowledge and open-source code with diagrams, explaining various concepts and common problems in real-world, from this knowledge reference you will be able to learn agentic systems from the beginning to deploy your Agentic workflow into production. 


> ***Note:** When addressing a real-world problem, LLMs should not be the default choice. Start by identifying the simplest and most effective solution—such as a rule-based system, traditional ML, or deep learning. Only consider LLMs when the problem’s complexity genuinely requires them.*

## Prerequisites 

### 1. ML
![ml-pipeline](assets/ml.png)
**Machine Learning (ML)**: Is a subset of AI in which system learns patterns from data instead of being explicitly programmed.

**Applications**:
- Email Spam Detection.
- Customers Groups Clustering.
- Recommendation systems

**Sources To Learn:**

**Deep Learning (DL)** : Is a subset of Machine learning uses **neural networks with many layers** to automatically learn features.

**Applications**: 
- Image recognition
- Speech recognition

### 3. Transformers
**Transformers**: Are a **neural network architecture**  presented in (2017) "Attention is all you need".
used to train on a massive text dataset to produce a pretrained model (Encoder or Decoder or Both).
![transformers](assets/transformer.png)
**Applications**:
- Encoder:
	- Text Embeddings (Semantic Search)
	- Token labeling (NER).
	- Classification.
	- Example : BERT Model
- Decoder:
	- Predict next word.
	- Language models like GPT
- Encoder + Decoder:
	- Text summarization 
	- Translation
