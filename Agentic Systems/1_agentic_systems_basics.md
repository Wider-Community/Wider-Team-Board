# Overview

This will be your start point to understand Agentic System, you need to understand each concept in this file, use any sources you need.

---

### 1) **Automation**

Rule-based execution of predefined steps.

- No learning or reasoning
    
- Follows fixed logic (if-this-then-that)
    
- Example: Cron jobs, RPA scripts, ETL pipelines


*Like turning on/off a led, you just need to click the button and the electricity will flow into the wire to turn on your led*

---

### 2) **AI Automation**

Automation enhanced with **AI models** for perception or prediction.

- Uses ML/LLMs inside fixed workflows
    
- Decisions are _assisted_, not autonomous
    
- Example: Auto-classifying emails, OCR → rules → action
    

*Like spam detection classifier. when an email is received it classify it automatically without telling you. it just happens in the background in a fixed steps*

---

### 3) **AI Agents**

An autonomous AI entity that:

- Has a **goal**
    
- Observes state
    
- Reasons, plans, and acts
    
- Can use tools and memory
    

Unlike AI automation, agents **decide what to do next**, not just execute steps.

---

### 4) **Workflow**

A **structured sequence of tasks** with defined transitions.

- Can be manual, automated, or AI-assisted
    
- Deterministic flow
    
- Example: DAGs, BPMN, Airflow pipelines
    

**Like a customer support email, responsible for answering user queries from the company database or provided knowledge base. it process this job in a fixed steps or a fixed rules.**

---

### 5) **Agentic System**

A system composed of **one or more AI agents** orchestrated together.

- Agents collaborate, delegate, retry, and adapt
    
- Combines planning + memory + tools + feedback loops
    
- Dynamic control flow (not fixed like workflows)
    

**A system we can't predict the output of it, and can't know the path which it will take. The AI Agents decide which path to take to solve the problem, AI Decide what to do**
