# Overview

This will be your start point to understand Agentic System, you need to understand each concept in this file, use any sources you need.

---

### 1) **Automation**

Rule-based execution of predefined steps.

- No learning or reasoning
    
- Follows fixed logic (if-this-then-that)
    
- Example: Cron jobs, RPA scripts, ETL pipelines


*Like turning on/off a led, you just need to click the button and the electricity will flow into the wire to turn on your led*

---

### 2) **AI Automation**

Automation enhanced with **AI models** for perception or prediction.

- Uses ML/LLMs inside fixed workflows
    
- Decisions are _assisted_, not autonomous
    
- Example: Auto-classifying emails, OCR → rules → action

### 3) **AI Agents**

An autonomous AI entity that:

- Has a **goal**
    
- Observes state
    
- Reasons, plans, and acts
    
- Can use tools and memory
    

Unlike AI automation, agents **decide what to do next**, not just execute steps.

---

### 4) **Workflow**

A **structured sequence of tasks** with defined transitions.

- Can be manual, automated, or AI-assisted
    
- Deterministic flow
    
- Example: DAGs, BPMN, Airflow pipelines
    

---

### 5) **Agentic System**

A system composed of **one or more AI agents** orchestrated together.

- Agents collaborate, delegate, retry, and adapt
    
- Combines planning + memory + tools + feedback loops
    
- Dynamic control flow (not fixed like workflows)
